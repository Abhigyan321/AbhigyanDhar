    <div id="div02"><b>Rolls Royce Phantom</b></div>
    <div id="div2"></div>
    <div id="div2a">Rolls-Royce has used the Phantom name on full-sized luxury cars over the past century, and is the second, longest-used automobile nameplate in the world after the Chevrolet Suburban. The Phantom is a low volume, hand-built limousine, which in earlier generations was custom built to the customers desires, and sometimes extravagant whims. As automobile manufacturing became more prolific, and vehicles from other manufacturers could be built in greater numbers and at reduced prices, the Phantom remained hand-built and production of individual models only began once the order was placed. The use of the name "phantom" is a long tradition of naming models after "ghosts".Earlier versions from Rolls-Royce consisted of the chassis and engine, then arrangements were made to customize the body and interior to whatever the buyer requested. The Phantom is popular with wealthy business people, royalty and celebrities who desire the best of everything, and want a car with exclusivity and elegance. During the years 1931-1998 when Rolls-Royce also manufactured Bentley vehicles, the Phantom was exclusive to Rolls-Royce and the approach to opulent vehicles wasn't shared with Bentley. When Bentley was an independent automaker, they did produce on a limited basis the Bentley 8 Litre limousine. When Rolls-Royce assumed operations and ownership, the 8 Litre was discontinued.Bentley would not manufacture a limousine until 2002 when the Bentley State Limousine was presented to Elizabeth II.</div>

    <div id="div3a">The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.

        The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style made available soon after. M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4. Variants of the 3 Series since then have seen the M3 produced as a saloon, until 2020, when the M3 was produced as an estate (Touring) for the first time, alongside the saloon variant.[1][2]

    <div id="div6"></div>
    <div id="div6a">The Mini (stylised as MINI) supermini range, marketed under various names such as Mini Cooper, Mini Hatch, Mini Hardtop, Mini One, and Mini John Cooper Works, are a family of retro-styled three-door hatchback, two-door convertible, and five-door hatchback (since 2014). The range was introduced in July 2001, following the acquisition of the Mini brand by German automaker BMW.

        BMW first unveiled the Mini hatch concept car at the 1997 Frankfurt International Motor Show, when the Mini brand was still part of the BMW-owned Rover Group. Developed as a successor to the original Mini, the styling of the concept car was well received by the public and further developed. The new Mini range was launched by BMW in 2001, one year after their sale of the Rover Group in March 2000, and the classic Mini's discontinuation that same year. Under BMW ownership, the brand later grew its line-up by adding larger models such as the Clubman in 2007, the Countryman in 2010, the Paceman in 2012, and the Aceman in 2024.
        
        The second generation was launched in 2006 and the third, adding a longer 4/5-door hatchback, in 2014. A two-door convertible version was added in 2004, followed by its second generation in 2008. With the launch of the fourth generation in 2024, the Mini Hatch has been renamed to Mini Cooper.[2]
        
        BMW also developed several battery electric versions of the Mini, starting with the Mini E in 2009 developed only for field trials, followed by the mass-produced Mini Electric in 2019, and succeeded by the Mini Cooper E/SE in 2023 which uses a dedicated electric vehicle platform.
        
        Mini models under BMW ownership are produced in Cowley, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom at Plant Oxford. Between July 2014 and February 2024, 3-door production was shared with VDL Nedcar in Born, Netherlands.[3] The Mini convertible was only assembled in the Netherlands between 2015 and 2024.[4] From 2024, all next generation combustion engined Mini hatch and convertible production will be centred at Oxford.[5] Since late 2023, the electric Mini Cooper is developed and produced in China at the Spotlight Automotive joint venture facility in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu.</div>

    <div id="div9a">The Lamborghini Urus is a high performance luxury SUV manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini. It was introduced in December 2017 as a 2018 model year production vehicle. The Urus is the first Lamborghini SUV and five-door vehicle in the modern era (under the ownership of Volkswagen Group), and the second SUV in the brand's history after the LM002, which was produced between 1986 and 1993.The name comes from the urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs.The Lamborghini Urus concept was unveiled at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show on 23 April 2012.Later, the SUV was also shown at Pebble Beach in 2012. Powered by a 5.2-litre V10 engine shared with the Gallardo, the engine generated a theoretical maximum power output of 600 PS (592 hp; 441 kW) and was accompanied with an all-wheel-drive system. The sharp-lined exterior design of the SUV takes heavy influence from the company's V12 flagship, the Aventador.Previously, Lamborghini had trademarked the name "Urus" before the introduction of the Lamborghini Estoque at the 2008 Paris Motor Show, and automotive news blogs Jalopnik and Autoblog believed that the name would be applied to what was eventually found to be the Estoque.On 4 December 2017, the Urus was unveiled at Lamborghini's Sant'Agata Bolognese headquarters, making it the brand's first SUV since the LM002.The production version of the SUV received major changes to the exterior and featured a different powertrain than that of the concept. Production of the new Urus started at Lamborghini's refreshed Sant'Agata facility, ahead of first deliveries in early 2018 with a targeted sales volume of around 3,500 a year.However, Lamborghini had to expand their factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese to meet the higher demand.In July 2020, the company announced the 10,000th unit of the Urus.In 2022, Lamborghini hit a major milestone by producing 20,000 of these SUVs, making the Urus the company's best-selling model in the shortest time.</div>
